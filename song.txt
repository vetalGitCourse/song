OK
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor, alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything
But little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor
I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK
Oops my C-D just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl
Girl girl girl (now you know you're my world)
Alright now lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby aah aah, oh baby baby aah aah

It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party
All the way to Sunday, maybe 'till Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy
Get the top down, let my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl
Girl girl girl (now you know you're my world)
Alright now lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby aah aah, oh baby baby aah aah
